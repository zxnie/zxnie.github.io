One of the bicycle-sharing services ‚ÄúMobike‚Äù caught my attention.<br>Bicycle-sharing could help office worker with the ‚ÄúLast Mile‚Äù; After taking off the railway, a number of passengers have still a 10-minutes‚Äô walk or bus to get to the office. This short trip is not enough to drive them to purchase for a new bike let alone under the risk of being stolen. Also, more bike on the road could ease the traffic congestion during the morning/evening rush hours.<br>„ÄÄOccasionally, on my way to the bank, I saw those conspicuous, orange-colored bikes on the wayside. I started my first ride after I installed the mobike app, paid the deposit and scanned the QR code on the nearest bike. Less than 3 seconds, the lock of the bike clicked, the app reminded me to turn on the bluetooth of the phone in order to unlock quickly. The app could record the time, route and distance of each ride so that they could calculate the cost. Later, I arrived the bank, locked the bike manually. With the beep from the bike, the app showed the cost, distance, energy consumption of this trip. Thus, I finished my first trip with mobike.<br>„ÄÄI become curious about how mobikes work. The app could provide the specific location the each bike, unlock the chosen bike and percept the manual lock of the bike, which means the bike could upload the location, the lock action and receive the unlock instruction. It seem that the secret lies in the smart locker. Referencing some news and discussions on the internet, I suspect a possible mechanism of mobike.<br><img src="/images/locker.png" alt="Logic diagram"><br><small>¬∑ The logic structure of electrical system</small><br>„ÄÄThe electrical system of the locker contains of a MCU, a GPS module, a<br>GPRS module, a rechargeable battery, a bluetooth module and other physical constructions such as a generator and a motor.</p>
<ul>
<li>GPS: access the location of the bike</li>
<li>GPRS: upload the location to the server and receive the command of unlock. (through the SMS, WAP or GPRS)</li>
<li>Bluetooth: establish a connection between the locker and the phone, making more instant control possible<br>„ÄÄSince the official claims that the mobikes have a longer life cycle: 4 year without maintenance, it should contain an electricity generator to ensure the work of the electrical system.<br><img src="/images/aHR0cHM6Ly9tbWJpei5.jpg" alt="locker"><br><small>¬∑ Eight generations of smart locker</small><br><small><a href="http://mobike.com/2016/11/16/%E4%BB%8A%E5%A4%A9%E8%B5%B7%EF%BC%8C%E5%86%8D%E4%B9%9F%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%A4%A7%E9%95%BF%E8%85%BF%E5%92%8C%E5%B0%8F%E7%9F%AD%E8%85%BF%E4%B9%8B%E5%88%86/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pic Source: http://mobike.com/</a></small><br>„ÄÄIt seem that recently, mobike have adopted the IoT solution provided by Ericsson, Qualcomm and mobile carriers from China. Therefore, the new Cat-M1 could replace the GPRS bringing longer support from the carriers. Starting a strategic partnership with Foxconn could also help mobike to further reduce the cost of each bike. Notably, customized physical unit making a mobike cost nearly 870 USD at first. In a sense, mobike have become an experiment of large-scale IoT network and share economy with a positive view from the capital.<br><img src="/images/MG_3384-768x512.jpg" alt="customized unit"><br><small>¬∑ Customized units of Mobike</small><br><small><a href="http://mobike.com/2016/11/16/%E4%BB%8A%E5%A4%A9%E8%B5%B7%EF%BC%8C%E5%86%8D%E4%B9%9F%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%A4%A7%E9%95%BF%E8%85%BF%E5%92%8C%E5%B0%8F%E7%9F%AD%E8%85%BF%E4%B9%8B%E5%88%86/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pic Source: http://mobike.com/</a></small><br><small><br>References:<br><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/47338133" target="_blank" rel="external">1.

            <p>„ÄÄAs Steve Jobs said ‚ÄúStay hungry, Stay foolish‚Äù, I should keep plentiful energy and enterprising spirit in order to make a great achievement in the field of Electrical Engineering, and become a distinguished electrical engineer. This is my power of studying abroad, and I believe that your school will help me accomplish my goal.</p>
<p>„ÄÄMy interest in electronics dates back to the year of 1998. Although I was a little child at that time, I was extremely curious about how did the electronics work and what the functions they equipped with, so I used to throw myself into exploring their inner structures. Knowing what I was interested in, my parents always allowed me to play with their newly purchased electronics, such as electronic watch and BP beep pager. The magic power of electronic devices kept me spellbound for them.</p>
<p>„ÄÄIn the year of 2004, my passion for electronics, especially the communication network, was strengthened again when I owned my first computer. Compared with the bygone electronic devices, the computer brought me more pleasant. During that period, almost all my spare time was spent in investigating the functions of Windows, including the settings of control panel, the directory structure of Windows and the modification of registry keys, which deepened my cognition towards computer structure. In addition, I began to pay attention to the magazines and websites referring to communication network and computer knowledge like Netfriends. The extensive reading broadened my horizon greatly, as well as intensified my interest in electronics, even stirred up my belief to be an electrical engineer in the future.</p>
<p>„ÄÄIn the year of 2010, I bought my first smartphone and began my mobile internet life. I was so excited that I could search for the information and communicate with my friends by using it, even though it had a small screen size and incomplete functions. However, the emergence of iPod Touch in 2011 further perfected the using functions and realized the touch screen function. All of these let me enjoy the inventions brought by electrical technologies. </p>
<p>„ÄÄIt was not till I enrolled in the College of Electronic Information and Control Engineering at Beijing University of Technology in 2012 that I really had access to acquire the systematical electrical knowledge and witness that our life was more and more informational with the development of electrical technologies. In our campus, we could use a small card to eat in the canteen, shop in the supermarket, read books in the library, shower in bathroom and make an appointment for conducting experiments in the laboratory. Along with the accumulation of knowledge, I got to know all of these conveniences were brought by computer and electrical technologies. Therefore, I attended the elective courses of Embedded System, Database and Single Chip Microcomputer during my undergraduate study to hone my professional abilities and lay the foundations for my future researches in the field of electrical engineering.</p>
<p>„ÄÄIn short, I have never ceased my thirst for electrical engineering. I am looking forward to furthering my study in electrical engineering and preparing to plunge into the oncoming challenges. Internet of Things and Smart Home have become my interest of research after I read from the magazines and got in touch with some conceptual designs from the internet. The reason is that those innovations could serve the public and bring higher quality and efficiency to their life. I am ready to start off right here, right now!</p>

            <p>After gathered the data of field intensity of wireless signal, I considered how to make full use of the data. Inspired by Prof. Yang, I realized that the composition of our data resembles those of Sports &amp; Running apps: we have both the coordinate of each point, the frequency and field intensity are correspond to something like speed or heartbeat. Thus, I installed a series of running apps and analyzed the way they show those data to the users. Notably, they have a week view or a month view which reminded that we should also take the date into consideration. In some extreme weather, the rains and winds could have effect on the signals.</p>
<p>Then, I learned from some book about data mining and data visualization, coded to show our data in different perspectives including maps and charts. Through our tools, our users could get some conclusions from the data easily.</p>
<p>Here is a demo of data on map.<br>Our test device have got the field intensity along a specifit route. From red to green, a color band is set to show the intensity from strong to weak.</p>
<p>You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>scroll for zoom;</li>
<li>drag to move;</li>
<li>click the point and get further information</li>
